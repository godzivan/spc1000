Version 1.3.1 (2013/04/20)
--------------------------
Fixes:
* Fixed a bug in a8cas-convert. When user provided an invalid value to a
  command-line parameter, the program silently ignored the parameter instead of
  warning the user.

Version 1.3.0 (2011/09/24)
--------------------------
New features:
* Changed the build system from Cmake to Autotools.
* Added a new option, --silence-level. When reading from a sound file, this
  value controls level of signal's amplitude under which all signal will be
  ignored and read as logical 1.

Version 1.2.0 (2010/04/18)
--------------------------
New features:
* Added the --version option to a8cas-convert. a8cas-info now also displays
  version number.
Changes:
* Simplified the command-line options in correlation to the updated liba8cas
  1.2.0 interface. The options --std-header-deviation and
  --nonstd-header-deviation are replaced by --header-deviaiton, and the option
  --nonstd-header-length is renamed to --header-length.
* Migrated the project to the CMake build system.

Version 1.1.0 (2010/04/09)
--------------------------
New features:
* A bunch of new command-line options: --std-header-deviation,
  --bit-deviation, --stop-bit-deviation, --nonstd-header-length,
  --nonstd-header-deviation, --baudrate-deviation for use when writing
  to CAS/HEX/RAW from sound files. The options adjust new parameters available
  in liba8cas 1.1.0.

Version 1.0.0 (2010/03/01)
--------------------------
First stable release.

New features:
* New option -r in a8cas-convert - allows to open a "raw" file (BAS, XEX) for
  reading. (Without -r a "raw" file is not recognised as a valid file).
* Error mesasages are now a bit more descriptive.

Version 0.2.2 (2010/02/20)
--------------------------
New features:
* a8cas-info now displays whether a file is seekable by blocks or samples.

Version 0.2.1 (2010/01/21)
--------------------------
* Fixed some minor errors. Adjusted to work with liba8cas 0.4.0.

Version 0.2.0 (2010/01/11)
--------------------------
* Compiled successfully on MS Windows.

Version 0.1.0 (2010/01/07)
--------------------------
First public release.
